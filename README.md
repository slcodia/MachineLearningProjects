# My Machine Learning Projects for my Portfolio

I have been studying Machine Learning through datacamp, kaggle, and other free online courses. This is a repository of my sample projects based on what I have learned so far.

## 1. Recommender System
Using Spotify songs, create an algorithm that recommends another song based on the preferences of a user, or likeliness (relatedness) of a song to another song. 
This is in two parts:
- Application of Supervised Machine Learning
- Application of Unsupervised Machine Learning
